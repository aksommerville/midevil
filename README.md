# Midevil

MIDI file editor that runs in a web browser.

## TODO

- [ ] Copy/paste.
- [ ] Encode to base64 or JSON (or other things?) and display for the user to copy out.
- [ ] Open/Save via HTTP GET/PUT.
- [ ] EventsModal: Serial payloads.
- [ ] Auto-scroll to playhead? At least make it an option.
- [ ] VisibilityUi: Comment on track and channel options, is there anything to see for each?
- [ ] Find a more elegant way to show Meta, Control, Aftertouch. Don't just print in the chart like notes.
- [ ] Track list in visibility popup needs to update when you add a track.
- [ ] Keyboard modifiers mostly don't work on MacOS (Chrome at least), they get interpretted as right click.
- [ ] "now playing" notes can be occluded by "background" notes, unexpectedly
